# leaderboard-package-mocha
Example of how to use mocha for package level testing (instead of TinyTest)

To run the tests for the string-reverser package included here run

`meteor test-packages --driver-package respondly:test-reporter string-reverser`

This example uses [respondly:test-reporter](https://github.com/respondly/meteor-test-reporter) and [mike:mocha-package](https://github.com/mad-eye/meteor-mocha-web/tree/packageTest)
